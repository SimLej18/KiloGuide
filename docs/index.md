## Presentation

This guide aims to help you to learn how to use [kilobots](https://www.kilobotics.com).

It has been created for anyone interested in kilobots and [swarm robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics), novice or expert.

## About Kilobots

Kilobots are small, minimalist and cheap robots designed by a team from the university of Harvard. They are equiped with all the necessary components to implement swarm behaviors.

---

## Organisation

This guide is divided in **two sections**.

The [**guides**](guides/guide-index.md) aim to explain you basic kilobots operations, such as "transferring code to the kilobot", "calibrating the kilobot" or "using Kilo-GUI".

The [**tutorials**](tutorials/tuto-index.md) focus on the implementation part. With tutorials, you will learn how to code for the kilobot through easy and diverse projects.

If you haven't used kilobots yet, you should probably start by reading the [getting-started guide](guides/getting-started.md).

## Resources and troubleshooting

There are a few important resources available online about kilobots. This guide has been designed has a minimalist introduction to kilobots and swarm robotics. Therefore, if you want to dive deeper in the kilobot universe or have experienced a problem during your learning process, you should check the following websites :

* [The kilobotics website](https://www.kilobotics.com)
* [The kilobot library](https://www.kilobotics.com/docs/kilolib_8h.html#ae35dbec14e979e7d894daa919dc47582)
* [The kilolib source code](https://github.com/acornejo/kilolib)
* [A "getting started" wiki for kilobots](https://diode.group.shef.ac.uk/kilobots/index.php/Getting_Started:_How_to_work_with_kilobots)
