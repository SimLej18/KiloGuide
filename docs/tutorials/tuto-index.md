## [<u>Morphogenetics</u>](tuto4.md)

## [<u>Rush Hour</u>](tuto5.md)

**Number of kilobots** : arbitrary

**Topic** : collective behavior

In this tutorial, a lot of kilobots are placed in a limited space. As they move around randomly, they must display different colors depending on the number of kilobots they detect around them. The goal is to obtain some heat-map of the kilobot concentrations at a high scale.
